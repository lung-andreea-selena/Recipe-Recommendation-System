        <p>
        Start on the <strong>Home</strong> page by browsing the <em>Available Ingredients</em> list.
        Tap the add
        icon next to an item to move it into your personal pantry.  
        You’ll need to choose <strong>at least three</strong> ingredients before any recipes can be shown.
        </p>

        <p>
        Every ingredient you pick is displayed in the <em>Selected Ingredients</em> card on the right.
        If you change your mind, just tap the
        remove icon beside an ingredient to take it out.
        Looking for something specific? Use the search bar above the lists to filter ingredients as you type.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you’re happy with your selection, click <strong>Show me recipes</strong>.
        In a few seconds the results appear, sorted by how closely they match what’s already in your kitchen.
        Recipes that require <strong>no extra ingredients</strong> are listed first
        so you can start cooking right away. After the zero-extra list, you’ll see dishes that need one or more additional items.
        </p>
